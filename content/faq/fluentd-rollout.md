## Question

How will `fluentd` be rolled out?


## Answer

We deploy `fluentd` as a `DaemonSet` that runs on all nodes. It forwards/annotates all logs with contextual information, then ships it to a log sink. We've used Datadog logs, CloudWatch logs, and ElasticSearch. It supports a multitude of other backends, including Splunk and S3.
