## Question

How does Amazon's Simple System Manager (SSM) differ from Parameter Store?


## Answer

Parameter Store is a feature of SSM.  However, in practice, it's the only feature of SSM that we use, so when we refer to SSM it almost always means "Parameter Store."

For example, if you use the AWS web console, then you would navigate first to Amazon Systems Manager, then find the "Parameter Store" menu option.
